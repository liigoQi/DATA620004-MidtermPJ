## Model & Dataset

We use ResNet-34 for image classification on CIFAR-100. When you train or test the model for the first time, CIFAR-100 will be downloaded automatically.

## Training 
The training and testing should be operated in the *resnet* folder. Here is an example command to begin training:

```bash
python train.py --lr 0.005 --weight_decay 0.001 --epochs 25 --batch_size 32 --data_aug mixup 
```

Parameters:

- lr: learning rate (default: 0.01)
- weight_decay: regularization parameter (default: 0.0001)
- epochs: number of epochs to train (default: 10)
- batch_size: (default: 32)
- data_aug: method of data augmentation, chosen from cutout, mixup, cutmix and None (default: None) 
- tuning: parameters adjusting mode, 0 for False and 1 for True. (default: 0)

After training, the model is saved in *model* folder with name showing data augmentation methods. Performance of models is shown in our report. 

## Testing 

```bash
python test.py --data_aug mixup
```

A trained model will be loaded and the accuracy of the whole test set will be printed. Necessary model must be downloaded into *model* folder or generated by training  before testing. 

## Visualization 

The visualization of three images and results of data augmentation methods (cutout, mixup and cutmix) can be obtained using *visualization.py*. Results is shown in our report.
